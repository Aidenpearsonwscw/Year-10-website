  <h2>Introduction:</h2>   

  <p>The Eastern Provinces Railway is a 1,371 miles long standard gauge double track mainline in the (fictional) republic of Rohenia, connecting Steven Street Terminal in the capital city, Rohenium to the coastal city of Lee-On-Sea. It opened on the 9th of December 1952 to much fanfair from the public. It was the final component in former prime minister Greg Johnstone's masterplan for intercity transport which consited of six major intercity railway corridors and numorus other minor railway corridors. This project also called for the construction of a network of superhighways but this was scaled back after a series of budget cuts during the second world war. </p>
